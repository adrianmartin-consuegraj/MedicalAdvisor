# What is this?
An Java EE app web focused on managing private information related to the health sector and also developed to manage the exchange of information from different users within the app (comments, scores, etc.). Everything related to the hospitals, clinics and pharmacies placed in Madrid.

# How does this work?
This app has been created using Java EE. I've used the first .html file to send the variables to the servlet via form, 
then I've used the session to store all the important information related to the user and the centers that was recovered from the data base, such as: locations, dates, favs or rates. With all the information in the session, the only thing that had left was to print all the information needed into the different .jsp files.
